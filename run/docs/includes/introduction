<p>Run is a platform to build apps and tokens on Bitcoin. Run supports full object-oriented programming and arbitrary code using JavaScript, and it is secure and performant for real applications today. This software development kit (SDK) will help you interact with the Run protocol, useful services, and Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Developers write applications using interactive objects, called jigs. Jigs allow you to build almost anything you can dream up: tokens, contracts, interfaces, elections, games, digital pets, and more â€” all run on Bitcoin.</p>
